This class is Climate Change and sustainability for Artists and Designers.

So, the first thing I hope we can do is share some common understanding about what climate change is.

The following is what I've learned/discovered/understood.

If you have questions or different understanding, bring it up and we will use today as a question generating opportunity. 

Understanding climate change means understanding earth's complex interconnected systems

{everything is connected}

Buckminster Fuller liked to refer to our planet as "spaceship earth" -- we float through space on our earth just like astronauts on a spaceship: we only have the air, food, and resources onboard.

{space ship earth}

Life is dependent on the energy from the sun and cosmos in order to sustain itself. Life as we know it can be understood as a vast system through which the suns energy travels. These systems are both biological and geological. We harvest energy from both these systems in the form of food and fuel.

Energy; all energy is sun energy in some form, even fossil fuels, they are fossilized deposits of biological matter produced on the earth millions of years ago. They have been called our “fossilized sunshine”.

Over the past 100 years our understanding of the earth's climate has gone from one of a inexhaustible, static system beyond the realm of human alteration to a delicate, interconnected system that can be effected by the impact of human behavior. It is possible to look at the earth’s many systems as manners with which energy is transferred from one place to the next. An activity of our oceans and atmosphere is to exchange energy in the form of heat. This exchange creates the dynamic that is our weather.

Our species is defined by its relationship to energy. Prior to the 19th century the main sources of energy were wood for cooking and heating, animals and wind for transportation and human labor for agriculture and manufacturing.

The Modern era/Industrial age is fueled by petroleum and coal. The parallel events of the discovery of fossil fuels and the invention of engines are what have defined our civilization for the past 150 years. The mechanics of engines are what give us access to the concentrated energy held by the fossil fuels. Supported by this highly concentrated form of solar energy the worlds human population has expanded extremely quickly.

It is valuable to look at the parallel increase in population that follows this access to energy.

Estimates of world population:

1750: 791 mill. , 1900: 1.6 bill. , Today: 6.6 bill. , 2100: 9.5 bill.

In 150 years between 1750 and 1900 it is estimated that world pop grew by 609 million.

In 107 years between 1900 and 2007 world pop has grown by 5 billion. (update with today's numbers? throw in 1999 to 2019; since I graduated from high school!?)

Energy Density: Coal has an energy density 75% greater than wood, oil has an energy density 50% greater than coal. So in 200 years we moved from wood to oil, a source of energy 125% denser (does this math work out this way correctly?)

To return to the importance of engines: in order to access the energy stored in oil/coal, the substance needs to be burned. This burning does two things; it releases the energy and makes it available to perform work, like pushing a car around or boiling water to make steam for electricity production. And it produces smoke.

When carbon based fuels are burned the carbon locked inside them is released into the atmosphere as CO2 (more on this in the carbon cycle lecture!? -- link to that?), these with other manmade or anthropogenic gases (sulfur, methane, nitrous oxide, carbon tetra fluoride) remain in the atmosphere and have come to be termed “greenhouse gases” as they trap reflected solar radiation that would otherwise be released into space. This phenomenon was first identified by British scientist John Tyndell in 1859. (coincidentally same year as 1st oil well)

A way of understanding CO2 PPM is to think of a cube of air that is comprised of 1 mill. particles. The CO2 PPM number is how many of these particles that are made up of CO2. CO2 is reflective so the greater the PPM # the greater the reflectivity or heat trapping the atmosphere is.

The study of the history of the earth’s climate or “paleoclimatology” has focused since its origins in the mid 19th century around the puzzle of the cyclical nature of ice ages. The recurrence of ice ages over millennia had been recognized by people like Tyndell but what caused them was not well understood. There are many factors that appear to be connected to this cycle, solar variation, the wobbling of the earth’s axis and the presence of C02.

A paleoclimatologist named Lonnie Thompson who was pursuing CO2’s relationship to ancient changes in the earth’s temperature developed the technology and logistics capable of drilling through high altitude glaciers and looking at the air bubbles they contained, as they would show atmospheric conditions, as they were 1000’s of years ago.

The most recent of these cores were taken from the East Antarctic from a depth of 3.2 kilometers; the ice at this depth fell as snow 800,000 yrs ago.

These ice cores provide a clear scientifically reproducible correlation between the concentration of CO2 and the earth's temperature.

In general: More CO2 = hotter / Less CO2 = cooler

What is evident from the ice core record is that there has never been a period of high concentrations of CO2 without a corresponding increase in temperature (where do these figures come from, look up Thompson's works?)

Throw in something here about where we are at ppm wise?

How it's currently changing?

The this is how tings changed historically, this is where we are now graph ala Al Gore?

While contested as biased the source of this “hockey stick” slide made famous by Al Gore’s film as actually from various US Government websites produced during the Bush administration, chiefly NOAA and the EPA.

That CO2 is the chief cause of planetary warming is what has been under debate for the past 20 years. Some of this has been a debate among the scientific community. A great deal of it though has been a debate generated from the enormous economic and political consequences of a necessary withdrawal from a fossil fuel based economy.

This is an incredibly controversial subject. You will find a wide range of opinions, predictions and scenarios, they will range from ones that see climate change as beneficial in that there will be greater crop yields and a stimulus to scientific and industrial processes to the apocalyptic, ones that state that we are done as a species and there is nothing that can avert extinction of ourselves and most everything else.

For the purposes of sanity and this class we will try and stay on positive things; though this can be hard as even conservative/middle of the road places now are still very bad in terms of outlooks...

There is now a profound scientific consensus. In 2007 (update with most recent one! shit!) the IPCC, a UN chartered organization released its 4th assessment report. This report is comprised of peer-reviewed findings of 2,500 scientists from 130 countries.

(also, any references from the US one??? did I print these to read, are they in my piles???)

“Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increases in global average of air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising average sea level.”

IPCC 4th report summary NOV 2007 (AGAIN, UPDATE THIS!)

We are now entering an age that is beyond the highest concentration of CO2 in the planets observable history.

The present concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is approximately 387 ppm.

Sidenote: When this class first began the amount was 380ppm. (c02 ppm graphic since 2007?)

The IPCC states that there is a 90% certainty that manmade CO2 in the atmosphere is the strongest driver of atmospheric changes in 10,000 years. We can now understand ourselves as a force of nature.

What will happen?

This is now an enormous field of study and industry. The need to understand, predict and prepare for the impact of a warming world have engulfed scientists, economists, agriculturalists, world health and disease community, disaster relief agencies, engineering and architecture, and of course art and design.

A warmer atmosphere has consequences that are not fully understood or entirely predictable. (One good consequence of this so far is that in trying to understand CC we are learning a great deal more about the interconnected nature of our world.)

James Hansen of the Goddard Space Flight Institute has stated that the field of Climate Change has gone from one of “predictive science to the observable.”

So, as energy from the sun is trapped by the earth’s atmosphere this energy expresses itself in the form of heat. This is now causes several observable phenomena

This includes:
- Sea level rise: as the planet heats the glaciers and polar regions melt, also oceans expand as they become warmer. This affects everything from the flow of ocean currents, the life inhabiting the oceans to the majority of the world’s population that inhabits the coastal areas.
- Hurricanes: a 2009 study conducted by the National Science Foundation and published in the journal Nature finds that hurricane activity has increased in both frequency and strength and is at its “highest level in 1,000 years”
- Drought and flood: warmer land and sea surface cause greater evaporation rates that cause both droughts in equatorial regions and greater rainfall in higher latitudes. This has a myriad of repercussions from a decreasing water supply in arid areas, stresses on indigenous and agricultural plant species, animal migrations and human refugees.
- Species loss: the earths climate is changing faster than species can adapt, predictions for many species and the food chain they are part of is very dire. Every single study performed on animal species over the past one hundred years has generated results of stress and depletion.

The most recent IPCC report has stated that we are committed to 2-4 feet of sea level rise and 8-10 F degree increase in temperature by the end of the century. The IPCC findings state that this will result in over 70 million refugees.

Seen through an economic lens the cost of coping with such numbers of refugees and the loss of land could cripple even major nations.

I mentioned earlier that the current concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is about (387 THIS NEEDS UPDATING) the next important figure is 450. It is at this level that there is no historical precedent but computer modeling indicates a state of runaway climate change that is difficult for anyone to imagine our civilization continuing in.

We are on a path to reach that level sometime in the next 50 – 100 years.

It is now considered that in order for the atmosphere to remain stable a level of 350ppm must be reached, to do this we need to lower the amount of globally emitted CO2 by 90% by 2050.

(350.org wants us to get back to 350ppm for example as a sensible atmospheric number based on historic data)

What is also understood is that is that we don’t have 50-100 years to act. It takes awhile for the CO2 to reach the upper atmosphere. It also takes awhile to alter the industrial and social fabric of society. In modeling this, the scientific majority first led by James Hansen the Director of the Goddard Institute, the IPCC and now NASA to state in 2007 that we have approximately ten years before we are committed to passing this “tipping point”.

So, according to this timeline we now have 7 years remaining.

(the above 2 paragraphs are all off now; too old of data)

Very, very dire.

This is a global problem. It is important to note that the carbon in the atmosphere was put there over the past 100 years primarily by the US and to a lesser degree Europe and former USSR. China and India now have the fastest growing populations and economies, with China now leading the world in CO2 output.

We are on converging paths of crisis. No significant, easily accessible deposits of petroleum have been found in over 40 years. What is known to remain is either technically difficult or politically dangerous to obtain. Its horizon as an available source of energy can now be seen.

Concurrent with this are very serious threats to marine and terrestrial biological systems.

This completely overwhelming dilemma is now defining our current era. How we respond is defining our future.

It is also the focus of this class.

We will look at the range of problems and solutions from the individual to the global. We will look at how the fields of art and design are responding to this situation. We will discuss the possibility of our civilizations realigning its relationship to the planet. We will discuss how we consume its energy and manage our waste. We will study the potential of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources and look at innovations in designing industrial and social systems that will both mitigate the causes of climate change and adapt to its unavoidable consequences.
